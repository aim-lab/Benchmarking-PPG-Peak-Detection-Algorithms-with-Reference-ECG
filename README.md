# Benchmarking PPG Peak Detection Algorithms using ECG as a Reference
## Beat Matching - Are beats detected where expected: Takes pulse arrival time into consideration. 
## IHR-IPR - How similar is the Instantanous Pulse Rate (IPR) elaborated from the PPG to the reference Instantanous Heart Rate (IPR) elaborated from the ECG.
